> **Abstract**: What is the effect of the number of legislators on public service provision? In this paper, I use a formal model to show that increasing legislature size affects service provision if the Executive's bargaining costs decrease as the number of legislators increases. In a political setting, changes in bargaining costs depend on whether an additional legislator shares the Executive's party affiliation: More opposition members reduce the Executive's equilibrium public goods provision, while more government-aligned members increase it. I empirically access my theory by exploiting sharp discontinuities in city council size in Brazil. I show that an additional city councilor has a 91% chance of belonging to the mayoral coalition, and this significantly improves primary school enrollment, vaccination rates, and infant mortality. To investigate the mechanism, I surveyed former councilors and analyzed 346,553 bills proposed between 2005 and 2008. This paper has implications for the design of legislative institutions.
